## Hi there 👋 I'm Ruth!

I'm currently learning web development from scratch.  
This github contains all my coding practice, micro-projects, and progress as I grow.

### Current Focus
- Learning Javascript and React  
- Building small, focused micro-projects  
- Understanding programming fundamentals by doing real work  

### Micro-Projects
I'm tracking my hands-on projects and experiments here:
